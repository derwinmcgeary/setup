setup.git
=========
Clone and run this on a new EC2 instance running Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS to
configure both the machine and your individual development environment as
follows:

```sh
cd $HOME
sudo apt-get install -y git-core
git clone https://github.com/startup-class/setup.git
./setup/setup.sh   

```

Alternatively, just do
```
bash <(wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derwinmcgeary/setup/master/setup_WHATEVER.sh -O - )
```

To automate everything.
